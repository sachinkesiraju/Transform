=========

Code that shows that every number eventually, on adding to the reverse
of its digits, becomes a palindrome.

Level 2 algorithm on Top Coder high school championship.

For example, if the user enters 39, the result will be:

39
Not palindrome yet 93

Number after adding reverse 132

Not palindrome yet 231

Number after adding reverse 363

Palindrome 363

To make sure the loop doesn't go on for too long the limit is 1000000000.
