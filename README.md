Transform
=========

Code that shows that every number eventually, on adding to the reverse
of its digits, becomes a palindrome.

Level 2 algorithm on Top Coder high school championship.

In this problem, the limit of the number on adding is 1000000000.

For example, if the user enters 39, the result will be:

39
Not palindrome yet 93

Number after adding reverse 132
Not palindrome yet 231

Number after adding reverse 363
Palindrome 363
